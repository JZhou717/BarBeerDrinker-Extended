Creating a mock database. Covering ER diagram and relational schema design, random data generation, pattern implementation, and front end interface

First update with involving the creation of an ER diagram and relational schema

Second update involving creating csvs of mostly randomized tuples from set lists. This was done using Java. Patterns on the mock data will be implemented using SQL queries.

Lastly, we expect to create a front end web interface where the database may be reviewed and where queries may be ran.
